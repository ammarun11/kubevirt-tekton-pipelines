This repository shows how we can easily automate a process of installing Ubuntu,fedora or even Windows VMs on KubeVirt with Tekton Pipelines.

Tekton Pipelines can be used to create a single Pipeline that encapsulates the installation process which can be run and replicated with PipelineRuns. The pipeline will be built with KubeVirt Tekton Tasks, which includes all the necessary tasks for this example.
