tekton pipelines collections

This repository shows how we can easily automate installing Ubuntu, fedora, or even Windows VMs on KubeVirt with Tekton Pipelines.

Tekton Pipelines can create a single Pipeline that encapsulates the installation process, which can be run and replicated with PipelineRuns. The pipeline will be built with KubeVirt Tekton Tasks, including all the tasks for this example.

All guides will be posted on [ammarun.my.id](ammarun.my.id)
